<!--
This code is very similar to the new method except action to be updated instead of creating and defining an id.
In this scenario, we used form_for tag for the form action. It will perform better than form_tag.
Why because it will create interaction with the Model easily.
Therefore it is better to use form_for tag whenever you need interaction between the model and the form fields.
